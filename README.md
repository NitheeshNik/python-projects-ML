Stock Analysis and Forecasting with Machine Learning

This project offers a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of Tesla, Bitcoin, and Microsoft stock data. Using Python, machine learning, and time series forecasting techniques, the project explores historical data and projects future trends. The main features include:

    Data Exploration: Descriptive statistics, data cleaning, and visualization to understand stock trends and distributions.
    Feature Engineering: Creation of custom features based on stock metrics for enhanced model input.
    Classification Modeling: Application of various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) to predict stock movement.
    Forecasting with Prophet: Time series forecasting for long-term stock price predictions using Facebook's Prophet.
    Evaluation: Model performance assessed via ROC-AUC scores and confusion matrices.

The project can serve as a foundational resource for financial data analysis and predictive modeling, suitable for anyone interested in machine learning applications in finance.
