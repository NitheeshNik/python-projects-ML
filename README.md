Packages Used


1.Pandas:
* Used for data manipulation, loading datasets, and data cleaning. It allows you to create and manipulate data frames, ideal for structured stock market data.
  *Example use: Loading .csv files, cleaning and exploring data, creating new columns based on calculations.
2.NumPy:
 * Adds support for arrays and mathematical functions. It is useful for performing fast numerical computations.
* Example use: Calculating new columns or transformations (e.g., np.where for conditional operations).

3.Matplotlib and Seaborn:

* Used for data visualization. Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library, while Seaborn offers advanced and aesthetically pleasing plots, especially for statistical data.
* Example use: Line plots of stock prices, histogram plots of data distributions, correlation heatmaps.

4.Scikit-Learn (sklearn):

   * Core machine learning library in Python, used for implementing models, splitting data, and evaluating performance.
   * Modules used:
     * train_test_split: Divides data into training and validation sets.
     *   StandardScaler: Standardizes features to improve model performance.
     *   metrics: Provides ROC-AUC score and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
     *  LogisticRegression, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, etc.: Various machine learning models for classification.
     *  confusion_matrix: For visualizing model accuracy on classification tasks.

5.XGBoost:
 * A gradient-boosted decision tree library optimized for performance, especially useful for structured data like stock prices.
 * Example use: Included in the model list for testing against other classifiers to see which one performs best.

6.Prophet:
 * A time series forecasting library by Facebook, well-suited for stock and financial data with clear trends and seasonality.
 * Example use: Predicting future prices of Tesla, Microsoft, and Bitcoin by training on historical stock data.

7.DateTime:
* Manages date and time manipulation, allowing accurate handling of stock data with date stamps.
* Example use: Used to define forecasting periods and handle conversions to datetime format for plotting and analysis.

    
Program Overview

The project uses historical stock data for Tesla, Bitcoin, and Microsoft to perform analysis and predictions. Here’s the general workflow and logic:

1.Data Exploration and Cleaning:
* Loads datasets using Pandas and explores key metrics (mean, median, etc.) and distribution.
* Identifies and handles missing values, standardizes date formats, and adds columns for month, day, and year to support time-based analysis.

2.Feature Engineering:
   * Derives new features, like:
            * is_quarter_end: Indicates if the date is at the end of a quarter.
            * price differences: Calculates differences between prices (e.g., open-close, low-high) to capture market behavior.
    * Sets up a target variable for classification (e.g., predicting whether the price will go up or down the next day).

3.Data Visualization:
     * Provides visual insights with line plots (for stock prices), histograms (distribution of features), and correlation heatmaps (showing relationships between features).
    * Adds pie charts to visualize class distribution (target) for stock price movement.

4.Classification Modeling:
    * Splits data into features and target, then standardizes features.
    * Applies multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree, etc.) to classify stock price movement.
    * Evaluates each model using ROC-AUC scores and displays confusion matrices to analyze the accuracy of predictions.

5.Forecasting:
    * Uses Prophet to forecast stock prices for the next 10 years.
    * Each stock dataset (Tesla, Bitcoin, Microsoft) is reformatted to fit Prophet’s expected structure.
    * Prophet model forecasts the closing price, producing predicted values (yhat) with upper and lower confidence intervals.

6.Result Visualization:
    * Displays forecasted values as a line plot with shaded regions showing confidence intervals.
    *    Adds separate plots for Tesla, Bitcoin, and Microsoft stock price forecasts for a clear visual comparison.

Core Logic and Flow

1.Data Preparation:
    * The program first loads and cleans data for each stock, ensuring it's in a structured format for feature engineering and modeling.
    * Missing values are handled, and dates are formatted for time-based analysis.

2.Feature Engineering and Target Definition:
    * New features are calculated to make the data more informative for machine learning models.
    *  A target variable (1 if price increases, 0 if it decreases) is created to train classification models.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:
   * Models are trained on the engineered features to predict price movements.
   * Performance is evaluated on both training and validation sets, providing insights into each model's ability to generalize.

4.Forecasting Future Prices:
    * Prophet is used to create a long-term forecast, making the project valuable for future trend analysis.
    * Forecasts and confidence intervals are visualized to assess expected trends and possible variability.

This project applies machine learning and time series forecasting to financial data, showcasing a structured, step-by-step approach to data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization. It’s a robust example of how data science can be applied to stock and cryptocurrency forecasting.**
